    <p>Hello! There's not much here right now, but I plan to use this website to host
        personal projects and blog posts and my thoughts on different things. <br>
        First, I'll have to work on optimizing my web design skills.

        <p>Have you heard of Democritus? You may have heard of him in your high school chemistry classes before,
            as the Greek philosopher responsible for forming the first idea of an "atom" <br> that everything is composed of.
            The thing that's interesting to me is that he's often depicted laughing in art, which I found at when I saw the cover of <br>
            "Quantum Computing Since Democritus" by Scott Aaronson (a brilliant professor and book I have yet to read!) So, I looked up
            why he's depicted laughing always, and I found <a href="https://www.artstor.org/2016/04/21/whats-so-funny-democritus/">this story </a>
            The contrast of the story is so funny: everyone in the city believes him to be mad because of his laughter, but he's actually the sanest
            man ever. <br> Sane, because he had the most wisdom of what the world was composed of. It does have somewhat of a nihilistic tone, and I don't
            believe in coming to the conclusion Democritus had. But, the archetype of a single wise person who is loned by the rest of the world is fascinating.

        <p> Over the weekend I competed in HackTX! It's an annual hackathon at UT Austin where you have 24 hours to develop
        an app or tech product of some kind. It was my first hackathon, and I was under the impression that hackathons had a theme
        <br> that you had to build something around. I was wrong. My team's app was called Securcity, where users could report crimes
        that would appear on a Google Maps interface. It would start out crowdsourced, but eventually evolve to partner with local police
        and the university to make a more accurate map. <br> I learned a lot about working in a team, and I'm glad I got to experience the pain
        of learning React Native and front-end development. Honestly, I think it would've been easier to make the app in Unity (at least the frontend),
        since I have a lot of experience in that engine. But, I suppose to learn any framework you have to undergo the pain of getting used to it.
